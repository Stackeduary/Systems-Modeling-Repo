### Questions for Marlon and how does it relate to one of your own projects/career

1. Business process management reminds me of the latter half of The E-Myth Revisited where Gerber talks about the franchise model and the business development process. His thesis is that the commodity isn’t what’s important, the way it’s delivered is, and he talks at length about McDonald's and how each element of their business has been refined, perfected and is perfectly repeatable for each customer and each visit. How is BPM different from management consulting, and why is it lumped in with software engineering? It seems like BPM is a subset of management.

2. What is Apromore's tech stack?

3. What was the name of the company that made a fortune in the late 90s and early 2000s doing remote process automation Marlon mentioned?

Answer: 

IDS Scheer made a fortune in the 90s and 2000s did so by selling "SAP best-practice models" together with their modeling tool. They were later acquired by a larger company called Software AG.

UiPath made a fortune from RPA (robotic process automation) in the past 5 years.

Super cool!

Marlon's lecture was top-notch. I was initially skeptical about the topic because I assumed it was a purely business discipline (which is interesting itself). But he made a believer out of me when he demoed Apromore. Tools like this are what is going to make Naval's prediction true:

I don't know how the datasets are generated, but the fact that it can generate business process diagrams where the level of abstraction is a controllable variable was very impressive. 

I wonder if they've figured out how to start using Apromore to build future iterations of Apromore.
