#### 1. What is meta modeling, why is it interesting in the context of this class?

Modeling about modeling.

#### 2. What are typical application domains for meta modeling (in general and examples)?

Any complex system such as banking, healthcare, insurance, ecommerce.

#### 3. How and for what could you see yourself using meta modeling?

To create models of how models in a complex system change over time.

#### 4. What would be arguments against using meta modeling or potential critique or pitfalls?

Huge time commitment for very little return. If many practitioners in industry make very little time for modeling/architecture diagrams beyond class diagrams, sequence diagrams or component diagrams, then they are surely not going to squander time on meta modeling.
