## Feedback on others' presentation videos:

### Team 1

- Slickest marketing of all the project groups.

### Team 2 was my team

### Team 3

- It was a good idea to have everyone show their faces and explain their role in the project.

- I was impressed with their robust class diagram. Very thorough.

### Team 4

- Arguably the most well-engineered solution: Dockerized components and a testing suite is impressive.

## SysMod Project Bonus Nominations

My project mates Jason, Pabasara and Adil Abdurrazakli deserve extra recognition and bonus points for their contributions to KaiBank.

#### KaiBank MVPs:

**Adil**: co-product owner and tech lead; ran most of our bi-weekly meetings and provided a product vision along with a development vision; kept back end developers on task.

**Pabasara**: architecture owner with Kamil; built our entire project infrastructure herself; was one of the leaders of the back end development team.

**Jason**: built the front end virtually single-handedly. Was the main liaison between the back end team and the front end team, along with Adil. Also was a scrum master along with Matin.

## Group MSBS (Group 1) Bonus Nominations

My groupmates Matin and Sarp deserve extra recognition for their contributions to our group work in weeks 1-10. Our work product is, in my opinion, high quality, and that would not have been the case without Matin's and Sarp's contributions to the team. 

**Matin**:
- handled Lab 5 almost entirely by himself
- took on the leadership role in our team:
  - distributed tasks to the group and kept us on task
  - made sure our lab contributions were completed on time
  - served as a resource for questions and proofread our work

**Sarp**:
- played a major role in our development-heavy tasks such as in Lab 3
- served as a resource for technical questions
- rallied team members who needed to be rallied at a few key junctures
