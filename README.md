## Notes

### Week 1: Tuesday, September 7

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture01.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab01.md)
- Reflections:

The lecture was engaging. A lot of lectures at UT have the setup where the instructor just talks to (or at) students and students' learning is passive. Oftentimes the lecture is unengaging as well. But the first SysMod lecture wasn't like that at all. It was very interactive and engaging, and it felt like we were a part of a community.

I'm still a little uncertain what systems modeling is, but the mystery of it is one of the exciting parts. I'm also looking forward to approaching development from another angle than just typical development, even if that's Agile or Scrum. My goal in taking this course was to become a better developer, and I think that will be one of the benefits of having taken this course.



### Week 2: Tuesday, September 14

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture02.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab02.md)
- Reflections:

The lecture was engaging, just like the previous lecture. I worked in a team to list pros and cons about object diagrams.

My first attempt at creating an object diagram for the Estonian News Fetching App wasn't so good--I had the architecture all wrong. But I redid the diagram, which is located [here](lecture-notes/images/ENFA Object Diagram.png).

Along with Matin, we actively recruited new team members to replace Oleg, who had unenrolled from the class and the program. And we actively campaigned the teaching staff, particularly Ishaya, to help us find a fourth teammate. Fortunately, we were successful, and now we have a new team member, Sarp, who is quite knowledgeable, supportive and hardworking. 



### Week 3: Tuesday, September 21

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture03.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab03.md)
- Reflections:

Ulno's video of creating class diagrams in IntelliJ was fascinating and eye-opening. When we were all asked in Lecture 1 why we chose to take this course, and I wrote that I'm hoping it will help me become a better developer, I meant it. And Ulno's 30-minute video where he manually wrote code in IntelliJ to build the class diagrams filled some gaps in my knowledge about object-oriented programming in Java. 

As a result of this lecture, I've become especially interested in the relationship between class diagrams and code, and it's really cool that IntelliJ creates class diagrams for you from source code.

I experimented with PlantUML in my own time outside of class.



### Week 4: Tuesday, September 28

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture04.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab04.md)
- Reflections:

I'm struggling a bit with the distributed nature of lectures and breakout sessions within lectures. Going back and forth between several programs and several screens has me feeling somewhat disjointed and disorganized. Nevertheless, our four-person group had a strong discussion about personas during the breakout session.

There are so many modeling paradigms that it's making my head spin. 

Fulib is an interesting tool, but I will need more practice outside of the lab in order to finish the tasks.

After our consultation with Ulno during the lab about our user stories in Lab 1 and object diagrams in Lab 2, we began work on tasks for Lab 4, but we didn't even get the first exercise completed as we didn't understand how to use Fulib.

We will catch up and finish the assignment after today's lab session.

Stopped by Ulno's and Ishaya's demo tables at Delta Institute Day, Wednesday, September 29.



### Week 5: Tuesday, October 5

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture05.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab05.md)
- Reflections:

Metamodels were too theoretical for my tastes. Seems like more of a philosophical question than something a practicing software engineer would be very concerned about.



### Week 6: Tuesday, October 12

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture06.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab06.md)
- Reflections:

I was a bit cynical in my responses to the in-class survey about the role of SysMod. I've only worked in a software development production environment briefly, and diagrams were created, but they were bare bones. It seems to me that the more esoteric diagrams won't be used in industry much at all. And the diagrams that are used will most often be used or held in high regard by the people who actually create the diagrams--an architect or systems analyst for instance.

Seeing the rest of the class's responses did not drastically change my opinion.



### Week 7: Tuesday, October 19

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture07.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab07.md)
- Reflections:

Seeing Node-RED for the first time was really cool. I'm looking forward to using that tool.



### Week 8: Tuesday, October 26

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture08.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab08.md)
- Reflections:

The Sismic demo was cool. I am enjoying practicing with Sismic and look forward to the Lab 9 tasks.



### Week 9: Tuesday, November 2

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture09.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab09.md)
- Reflections: 

I got to help out with the event storming demo in class today. I didn't feel like I had much value to add during the demo, but I enjoyed the preparation process of watching demo videos of developers event storming and Alberto Brandolini explaining the practice at a developer conference. So I think I have a much better understanding of event storming than if I didn't do the prep work.



### Week 10: Tuesday, November 9

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture10.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10.md)
- Reflections:

After watching "5 Design Patterns Every Engineer Should Know", I am super stoked to have been exposed to those concepts and to learn about Jack Herrington's YouTube channel. His video scratched me right where I itch, for several reasons. One, he touches on the developer's career trajectory and gives a solid overview of the progression from junior to senior, lead, architect and principal, which I had never heard so succinctly before. Second, his discussion of going from framework consumer to framework producer was a seismic mindset shift for me. I finally understand the bifurcation between the average software developer and the big dogs who create the advancements in technology that the average developers use. Third, I didn't really know about any design patterns before his video, and now that I'm aware that they exist, including now knowing the high-level of five of them, I'm starting to see how so many pieces of software fall into these clean, compact, descriptive categories. For instance, I've been exposed to the pub-sub/observer pattern in the context of Redis and Kafka. But I thought those tools were just one-offs. I've obviously used many pub-sub systems in my life, but I had no conception or understanding of what a pub-sub system even is. Then someone like Jack Herrington comes along and phrases a concept in just the perfect way that it crystallizes in my mind and completely reframes how I view the world. And now I'm hungry to read the Gang of Four's design patterns book and discover the remaining 17 patterns that I've undoubtedly used. If it sounds like I'm gushing it's because I am. He ties all three big threads--career trajectory, consuming vs. producing frameworks and design patterns--masterfully. I never subscribe to YT channels but I might actually subscribe to his.

The best part is now that I know that Jack Herrington's channel exists, I can return for those perfectly phrased pearls of wisdom that I've been yearning for.

I also manned the projector for the in-person class in Ishaya's stead.

Career questions for Alex Lovell-Troy:

1. As someone who is also coming to software development from a liberal arts/non-traditional background (mathematics, in my case), what's your advice for getting one's first developer job that leads to career-long learning and an upward career trajectory? And how to defeat imposter syndrome?

2. How competitive is the application process for the New Grads program at Twilio? https://boards.greenhouse.io/twilio/jobs/3409275


I appreciated the comment that software architecture is more about people than software, that with a good specification, lots of people can write code. But the heavy lifting comes from appropriately defining the problem that needs to be solved. 

I agree--properly defining a problem to be solved is by far the most important part of the software development process.
