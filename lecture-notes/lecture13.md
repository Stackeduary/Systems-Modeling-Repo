### Questions for Albert ZÃ¼ndorf and how does it relate to one of your own projects/career:

1. What is the role of the event broker in the microservices architecture, and can anything from that service be modeled in Fulib at all?

2. Do financial trading platforms always use event brokers? I'll be taking part in a trading competition in February where we have to build an algorithmic trading bot (I was _just_ talking about this before this lecture started) and perhaps an event broker is what can set our group apart from others. Can I reach out to Ulno and Albert in January and February for some short, high-level coaching on this topic?
