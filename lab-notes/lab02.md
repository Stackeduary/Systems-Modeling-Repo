### Main responsibilities

In Lab 2, I was responsible for creating object diagrams for the ATM user stories that I created in Lab 1. 

I spent a huge amount of time creating then modifying object diagrams for the ATM user stories--I modified them at least three different times--because I had never created object diagrams before and had no idea I'd be so terrible at it the first time. Also, the user stories I created in Lab 1 were not the easiest to turn into object diagrams into Lab 2.

Note: after getting feedback on the user stories I created for the ATM scenario on Tuesday, Sept. 28, Ulno suggested that I create four new ATM user stories that are more fleshed out. This will enable me to create better object diagrams, and hence, better class diagrams. So I will now make a *fourth* attempt at generating object diagrams for the ATM scenario.
