## Lab 3 notes

Link to the group work is [here](lab-challenges/lab03/README.md).

### Main responsibilities

I was responsible for creating the object diagram for Paul, Paul's pen and Paul's paper.

I was also responsible for creating the class diagrams, cardinalities and code (i.e., the entire exercise) for the ATM user stories I had written in the first lab.
