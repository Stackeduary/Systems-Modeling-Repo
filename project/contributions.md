## Bill's Contributions to SysMod Project Team 1_6_13_11

#### Meeting 1: Friday, November 12

I took the role as the "first mover" on the team by:
- creating a Telegram group for us to communicate about logistics
- creating a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124dV8QfrcHp3Dshi_fRll-XtvBiEH5x4eXUAdMyvXAY/edit?usp=sharing) to organize everyone's weekly availability and possible meeting times
- creating an anonymous [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ecrjwv8ZM7x6CcaRouABQ00iY2YR6MX2TwcV-C4hQXI/viewanalytics) to solicit nominations for the various team leadership roles
- organizing our first team meeting
- creating a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F40jJxwFf8EL7-6pDpG1IUG1ghvYIYT-A2XhdcsyM90/edit?usp=sharing) outlining my vision of 
  - team structure
  - semi-weekly in-person meetings
  - a strong teamwork culture where we're not accountable to instructors but to each other
  - cross-functional team roles where we would each wear multiple hats and contribute to multiple areas of the project
  - arguing that people should assume roles that balance learning new skills while also contributing in a capacity where the individual already has strengths; for example, because I was the weakest programmer on the team, it wouldn't be in the team's best interest to assign me to a developer role because I'd be the weak link.

Despite assuming the role of the initial leader, I made it clear that I did not want to be scrum master on the project--that product owner or architecture owner would suit me better. However, final roles were decided on a loose team-wide vote.
