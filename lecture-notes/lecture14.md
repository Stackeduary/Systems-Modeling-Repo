### Feedback/suggestions for future iterations of the SysMod course:

1. More thorough demo of Sismic and statecharts. The Lab 9 task was confusing. There is a glaring lack of documentation and online community surrounding Sismic. Maybe a demo longer than just four minutes.

2. I would suggest adding deployent diagrams, more C4 and microservices architecture instead of meta models, which seemed too theorteical and useless in practice. My goal in taking this class was to learn about architectures and diagrams as they are practiced in industry. I personally avoid overly theoretical disciplines and gravitate more toward how things are done in the real world.

I was very grateful that Marlon gave a guest lecture in BPM. The nexus of business management and software engineering is fascinating stuff.
