### In-class Survey

#### 1. Product owner

Why: 
- Partly to justify their role and their paycheck (cynically)
- But also to create a unified plan for features and upgrades.

#### 2. Software architect

Why: 
- Partly to justify their role and their paycheck (cynically)
- To create a unified architecture that all agents interacting with the system can use to understand the system's functionality, uses and limitations.

#### 3. Initial software developer

Why:
- This one is the most obvious in my mind. A system model is huge in terms of creating a highly-functioning and maintainable system that meets the goals it was designed with.


### In-class Discussion

Notes for Group Number 1

Moderator: Bill

Note-Taker: Matin

Participants of the discussion: Timothy, Dami

#### Opening Notes

We are discussing components diagrams, their definitions and the main purposes. Presented a couple of examples. Got through the key points of these diagrams.

#### First Person Pro Notes

Since it does not include any functionality, each time we add new functionality, there is no need to update these diagrams as frequently, which makes them fairly consistent.

#### Second Person Con Notes

As it lacks a lot of details it does not give developers specific instructions.

Also, we are confused about the ports in the component diagram.

#### Third Person Pro Notes

It is fast to build a component diagram as it abstracts many features.

#### Fourth Person Con Notes

Yet another diagram that we have to create and maintain. And if someone does not maintain it, it could become deprecated.

#### Moderator Summary Notes

We had a spirited discussion, and we were able to stay friends afterwards.

#### Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes

Bill said that the static nature of the component is a con.

#### Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes

Dami argued that the static nature of the component diagram is actually a pro because the diagram/structure won’t change if there are small (i.e., daily) changes to the system.

#### Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes

Bill said that the abstract nature of component diagrams is a pro since insignificant details aren’t considered in the overall system.

#### Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes

Timothy argued that that is actually a con since developers and testers can lack guidance with such an abstract system.

#### Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes

Daichi says stridently that component diagrams are NOT applicable to software like web pages.

#### Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes

We all laughed at him. (Just kidding. Everyone loves Daichi, especially Estonian chicks)
