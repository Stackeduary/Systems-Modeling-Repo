### Career questions for Alex Lovell-Troy:

1. As someone who is also coming to software development from a liberal arts/non-traditional background (mathematics, in my case), what's your advice for getting one's first developer job that leads to career-long learning and an upward career trajectory? And how to defeat imposter syndrome?

2. How competitive is the application process for the New Grads program at Twilio? https://boards.greenhouse.io/twilio/jobs/3409275
